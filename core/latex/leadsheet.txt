{Verse}

[Am] On a dark desert highway,[E7] cool wind in my hair
[G] Warm smell of colitas [D] rising up through the air
[F] Up ahead in the distance,[C] I saw a shimmering light
[Dm] My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim,[E7] I had to stop for the night
{Chorus}

[F] Welcome to the Hotel Califo[C]rnia.
Such a [E7]lovely place, (such a lovely place), such a [Am]lovely face
[F]Plenty of room at the Hotel Cali[C]fornia
Any [Dm]time of year, (any time of year) You can [E7]find it here
