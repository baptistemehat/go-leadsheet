    \end{Intro}

    \begin{Verse}
        ^{Bm} On a dark desert highway,^{F#7} cool wind in my hair \\
        ^{A} Warm smell of colitas,^{E} rising up through the air \\
        ^{G} Up ahead in the distance,^{D} I saw a shimmering light \\
        ^{Em7} My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim, ^{F#7} I had to stop for the night \\
    \end{Verse}

    \begin{Verse}
        ^ There she stood in the doorway, ^ I heard the mission bell \\
        ^ And I was thinking to myself "This could be ^Heaven or this could be Hell" \\
        ^ Then she lit up a candle ^ and she showed me the way \\
        ^ There were voices down the corridor, ^ I thought I heard them say \\
    \end{Verse}

    \begin{Chorus}
        ^{G} Welcome to the Hotel Calif^{D}ornia \\
        Such a ^{F#7}lovely place ~~\color{gray}\textit{(Such a lovely place)}\color{black}~~ Such a ^{Bm}lovely face \\
        ^{G}Plenty of room at the Hotel Calif^{D}ornia \\
        Any ^{Em7}time of year ~~\color{gray}\textit{(Any time of year)}\color{black}~~ You can ^{F#7}find it here \\
    \end{Chorus}

    \begin{Verse}
        ^ Her mind is Tiffany-twisted, ^ she got the Mercedes bends \\
        ^ She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys ^ she calls friends \\
        ^ How they dance in the courtyard, ^sweet summer sweat \\
        ^ Some dance to remember, ^ some dance to forget \\
    \end{Verse}

    \begin{Verse}
        ^ So I called up the Captain ^ "Please bring me my wine." \\
        He said, ^ "We haven't had that spirit here since ^ nineteen sixty nine." \\
        ^ And still those voices are calling from ^far away \\
        ^ Wake you up in the middle of the night, ^ Just to hear them say  \\
    \end{Verse}

    \begin{Chorus}
        ^ Welcome to the Hotel Calif^ornia, \\
        Such a ^lovely place ~~\color{gray}\textit{(Such a lovely place)}\color{black}~~ Such a ^lovely face \\
        They ^livin' it up at the Hotel Calif^ornia \\
        What a ^nice surprise ~~\color{gray}\textit{(what a nice surprise)}\color{black}~~ Bring your ^alibis \\
    \end{Chorus}

    \begin{Verse}
        ^ Mirrors on the ceiling, ^ The pink champagne on ice \\
        And she said ^ "We are all just prisoners here, ^ of our own device" \\
        ^ And in the master's chambers, ^ They gathered for the feast \\
        ^ They stab it with their steely knives, But they ^just can't kill the beast \\
    \end{Verse}

    \begin{Verse}
        ^ Last thing I remember, I was ^ running for the door \\
        ^ I had to find the passage back to the ^place I was before \\
        ^ "Relax," said the night man, "We are^ programmed to receive \\
        You can ^check-out any time you like, ^ But you can never leave!" \\
    \end{Verse}
